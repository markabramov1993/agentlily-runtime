`agentlily-runtime` is the execution layer for AgentLily instances in Lily
Protocol, the autonomous agent finance infrastructure being built on Stellar.

This repository is intentionally designed as an open-source-ready runtime
foundation, not a completed runtime product. It provides:

- A modular TypeScript runtime architecture
- One real happy-path execution flow for contributors to study and extend
- Strict typing, tests, linting, and CI scaffolding
- Clear extension points for unfinished systems

## What Exists Today

The current implementation demonstrates a narrow, credible runtime path:

1. Create an `AgentRuntime`
2. Start the runtime and register tools
3. Build a runtime context for a task
4. Execute a task through the task runner and action executor
5. Invoke a typed tool
6. Persist lightweight in-memory task history
7. Emit runtime events and structured log entries

This gives contributors a working reference path without locking the project
into premature architecture.

## What Is Intentionally Unfinished

The following areas are scaffolded with interfaces, types, or placeholders and
are expected to become contributor work:

- Wallet-aware and payment-aware actions
- Persistent memory and state backends
- Model provider integrations (an `OpenAICompatibleModelProvider` scaffold is available for experimentation; note that it is scaffolded and intentionally not production-complete)
- Runtime policy engines and approval flows
- Long-running orchestration and scheduling
- Distributed execution and durable coordination
- Identity-aware execution logic
- Rich tracing, metrics, and production observability

## Repository Layout

```text
src/
  actions/     Minimal action execution flow
  agents/      Agent instance lifecycle scaffolding
  errors/      Typed runtime errors
  events/      Runtime event model and event bus

```

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

Example:

```ts
import { AgentRuntime } from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "local-dev"
});

runtime.registerTool({
  name: "echo",
  description: "Returns a string payload for test execution",
  async execute(input) {
    return { echoed: String(input.payload.message ?? "") };
  }
});

await runtime.start();

const result = await runtime.executeTask({
  agentId: "agent-demo",
  taskId: "task-001",
  toolName: "echo",
  input: "Send a greeting",
  payload: { message: "hello lily" }
});

console.log(result.output);
```

## Runtime Events

`RuntimeEventBus` exposes the runtime lifecycle as typed events so observers can
build audit logs, tracing adapters, metrics, or user-facing task status without
coupling those concerns to task execution.

| Event | Payload highlights |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime.started` | `runtimeId`, `occurredAt` |
| `runtime.stopped` | `runtimeId`, `occurredAt` |
| `runtime.task.received` | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId` |
| `runtime.task.completed` | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `toolName`, optional `durationMs` |
| `runtime.task.failed` | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `reason` |
| `runtime.tool.invoked` | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `toolName`, `invokedAt` |
| `runtime.internal.error` | originating `eventName`, `errorMessage`, `occurredAt` |

Inject a bus through `RuntimeOptions.eventBus`, subscribe before starting the
runtime, and keep the unsubscribe functions returned by `on()`:

```ts
import {
  AgentRuntime,
  RuntimeEventBus
} from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const eventBus = new RuntimeEventBus();

const unsubscribeCompleted = eventBus.on(
  "runtime.task.completed",
  ({ payload }) => {
    console.log("completed", payload.taskId, payload.durationMs);
  }
);

const unsubscribeFailed = eventBus.on(
  "runtime.task.failed",
  ({ payload }) => {
    console.error("failed", payload.taskId, payload.reason);
  }
);

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "local-dev",
  eventBus
});

await runtime.start();

// Later, detach observers when they are no longer needed.
unsubscribeCompleted();
unsubscribeFailed();
```

`RuntimeEventBus.on()` returns an idempotent unsubscribe function. The public
`off()` method is also available when you need to remove a listener by
reference, and `once()` can be used for a one-shot lifecycle observation.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` compiles the library
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` runs TypeScript in no-emit mode
- `npm run test` runs Vitest with coverage
- `npm run verify` runs formatting, linting, typecheck, and tests

## Contributor Guidance

Good first contributions should add depth without collapsing extension points.
Examples:

- Add a new memory backend that implements `MemoryStore`
- Introduce runtime policies around tool allowlists
- Add an event sink or tracing adapter
- Implement a model provider adapter with tests
- Expand task lifecycle states beyond the current happy path

## Suggested Next Issues

Maintainers can immediately create issues around:

- Provider adapters
- Runtime policies
- Persistent storage
- Wallet-aware execution boundaries
- Observability
- Documentation examples
- Test matrix expansion

The backlog section in the final delivery summary from this setup provides a
ready-made issue starter list.
